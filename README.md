My very own dotfiles
========

Let's have some dotfiles!

### Installing
This repository is designed to be used as a Homesick CASTLE. The following commands should be used to symlink all dotfiles, install oh-my-zsh and run all other install scripts.

```bash
gem install homesick
homesick jjdeker/dotfiles
symlink dotfiles
homesick exec dotfiles ./install
```
